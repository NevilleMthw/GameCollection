# GameCollection
Game collection website created with HTML5, CSS, Flask and Python.

This website which I made is about my game collection. My website lets users review the particular game only if they are logged in, however all users are allowed to view the reviews. 
<br>
A user can also search for a particular game and click on that game in order to review it. 
<br>
All non-signed in users can also sign in the guestbook in order to show their visit to my website.
